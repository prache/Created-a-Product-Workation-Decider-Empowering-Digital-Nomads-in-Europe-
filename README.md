# Capstone_project: Cost of living in European countries while being on 'workation'
Hereby, We are creating a product which helps 'digital nomads' to decide about their workation with their cost of living budget and other preferences. The current focus is on European countries. To shape our product we mainly use an artefact such as Python, postgreSQL, Tableau, and Microsoft Azure cloud-based database. We work in a team of 4 with agile methods to sculpt our project fast and the way we require it.
