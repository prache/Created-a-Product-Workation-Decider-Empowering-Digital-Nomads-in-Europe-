# Bootcamp Capstone Project: Cost of living in European countries while being on 'workation'

We created a product that assisted digital nomads in making informed decisions about their workations, with a specific focus on European countries. To shape our product, we primarily utilized artifacts such as Python, PostgreSQL, Tableau, and a Microsoft Azure cloud-based database. Working as a team of four, we employed agile methods to quickly sculpt our project according to our requirements. To explore the product, please click on the following link. Additionally, feel free to embark on your own journey of discovering the perfect workation spot.
